#Description
My own dotfiles. 

#Installation

* Clone the git repository to your home folder.
* Run `bootstrap.sh`. This will create symlinks in your home folder that 
link to the contents of the new dotfiles directory. It will store backups
of your existing dotfiles in a new directory called dotfiles_old
* The gitconfig file contains personal info that should be changed if any
one other than myself uses these files.
